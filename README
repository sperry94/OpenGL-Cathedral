Final Project

This program draws a cathedral in 3d with lighting (light location and sky color based on time of day) and textures enabled. To run this program, simply compile it using the makefile and then run ./final. The key bindings listed below can be used to manipulate the program. NOTE: TO EXIT THE CATHEDRAL IN FIRST PERSON, GO THROUGH THE WALL ON THE OPPOSITE END FROM THE ALTAR!

NOTE: CSCIx229.h, errcheck.c, fatal.c, loadtexbmp.c, object.c, print.c, and project.c (all files used by CSCIx229.h) were not written by me.
They were provided as a part of the CSCI 4229 course at CU Boulder. Additionally, some of the other code (some in final.c, some in Cathedral.c, and most of the makefile) was copied from in-class examples.
